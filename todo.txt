accomplished:
    forms both trains using full hand and trains using hand after removing domoinoes matching the starting double
    will not add duplicate trains to final train results
    will not play double if there is no follow-up dominoe
    prob can get rid of handsize in f()
    clean up variable names
    do a list of dicts, not a dict of dicts
    functionize output

todo:
    form into a class and combine recursion and output (watch for global variable naming)
    remove perfect trains from multi and full train output
    input improvement/cleansing
        if number is not a number <= 12 its no good
    add multithreading and caching

----------------------------
pass in handsize, fullTrain, multiTrain

iterate through full and multiStarts
    if len(train) = handsize add to perfect train

if len(perfectTrain) > 0:
    Congratulations, you have a perfect train! You win!
    traintotal
    train

otherwise do [playing with strategy? try these:][going for broke? try these:]
    trainRank, if 1 then output best
    output traintotal
    output train

----------------------------
no match
match without double
match with double
match with double without follow up

if len match == 1 and match is a double
    insert 0
if len match > 1 and match is a double
    normal iteration
if match is not a double
    normal iteration
