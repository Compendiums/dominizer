accomplished:
    forms both trains using full hand and trains using hand after removing domoinoes matching the starting double
    will not add duplicate trains to final train results
    will not play double if there is no follow-up dominoe
    prob can get rid of handsize in f()
    clean up variable names
    do a list of dicts, not a dict of dicts
    functionize output
    form into a class and combine recursion
    remove perfect trains from multi and full train output
    create config
    accept arguements (one being test mode)

todo:
    create tests for all scenarios
    add logging
    add error handling
    standardize quotes
    input improvement/cleansing
        partially complete, just need to cleanse the dominoes
    add multithreading and caching

----------------------------
pass in handsize, fullTrain, multiTrain

iterate through full and multiStarts
    if len(train) = handsize add to perfect train

if len(perfectTrain) > 0:
    Congratulations, you have a perfect train! You win!
    traintotal
    train

otherwise do [playing with strategy? try these:][going for broke? try these:]
    trainRank, if 1 then output best
    output traintotal
    output train

----------------------------
no match
match without double
match with double
match with double without follow up

if len match == 1 and match is a double
    insert 0
if len match > 1 and match is a double
    normal iteration
if match is not a double
    normal iteration
